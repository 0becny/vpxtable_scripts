<h1>This repo contains script files of visual pinball tables.

I love SSF tables so much that I could not stand playing older tables
that didn't have updated 7.1 code in them. What I've done is to find
what I consider the most essential code that is common for most tables
and updated it so that the table itself is ready for improvements.

While I was on this task - forum user 'WOB' made a spreasheet of what
tables is expected to work with the so called FastFlips. With his
help I hope that all the tables listed here will work. You could, if
you for some odd reason DON'T want to update the whole script just
copy part of the code.

Without the awesome work of DjRobX, nFozzy, Toxie and Fuzzel we would
still flippers that varies between 0-20ms. The community can't thank
you enough guys !

**NOTE**:

Not including Loserman's tables. I saw that he planned changes to them.
I hope they include updated routines. So, for the moment those are
kept out of this repository.

_So. On to it - how do I use it ?_

If you have a table with the exact name as the script. I'm hopeful
that you will be able to open up the script inside the table and delete
everything, replacing it by the code provided.

In some cases it will not only give you a upgrade, it should actually
fix some issues as well. There are a few tables that hasn't been updated
with the fixes provided by the community and I hope that they are included
here. If not, why don't we fix them ?

_Future feature ?_

There has been talks about supporting "side-car" table support. If that
happens - I will make sure that the updated code here will be made available
for everyone to download as a regular zip file and then you only should
  have to extract those files into the same folder as your tables.

  But for now that is not an option unfortunately.
